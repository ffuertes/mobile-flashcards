# Mobile FlashCards

This is the final assesment for Udacity's React native course.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React Native App.

## Platforms

This app was tested in Android. IOs is comming soon when I buy my new Iphone. For the moment just Android. :)

## Installing and Launching

For installing and launching the app you need to run two commands in the projects directory:

1. yarn install / npm install
2. yarn start / npm start

Make sure you have Expo app installed in your phone or a propertly configured emulator installed in your PC. 

If you choose to test in your phone, it must be connected to the same network as your PC.
